## Symmetric Group

the **symmetric group** $$S_n$$ on a [finite set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set) of _n_ symbols is the [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)) whose elements are all the [permutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation) operations that can be performed on $$n$$ distinct symbols, and whose [group operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_operation) is the [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition) of such permutation operations, which are defined as [bijective functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection) from the set of symbols to itself. Since there are $$n!$$ possible permutation operations that can be performed on a [tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple) composed of $$n$$ symbols, it follows that the [order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(group_theory)) \(the number of elements\) of the symmetric group $$S_n$$ is $$n!$$.

Note that the Symmetric Group of $$S_3$$ is the symmetries of the equilateral triangle. $$S_3 = \{I, R, R^2, F_1, F_2, F_3\}$$ . Where $$I$$ is the identity, $$R$$ is rotation by 120 degrees, $$F_i$$ is the flip action on each symmetric axis. Thus we can say the Group of Symmetries of the Equilateral Triangle is _**Isomorphic **_with $$S_3$$. 

Obviously, the Group of Symmetries of the Square is not $$S_4$$. Since the group doesn't have $$24$$ elements as expected for $$S_4$$. But, the Tetrahedron, the object with the lowest faces in the three dimensional space, has a great relationship to $$S_4$$. The Group of Symmetries of the Tetrahedron is _**Isomorphic**_ with $$S_4$$.
